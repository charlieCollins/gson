————————————

start with json, no deps beyond simple java (cheating a little) 

goal
compile java (just to make sure it works, extra step to get in habit) 
transpile to obj-c
compile objc-c
transpile/compile gson TESTS
run the tests as OBJECTIVE MUTHA FLIPPING C

notes from tom:
Here are the basic steps:

Run "rm -rf /tmp/build && mkdir /tmp/build"
Run "javac -d /tmp/build BLSSMIBI.java" (or whatever that file is named that created BLSSMIBI.o)
Run "find /tmp/build -name '*.class' | fgrep -v '$' | sed 's/class$/java/' | sed 's/\/tmp\/build\///' > sources.list
Run "sed 's/java$/m/' sources.list > objc-files.list

The first step creates a clean build environment. 
The second step compiles the Java source; javac will also compile any dependent classes that are in the source path ("." by default). If the javac command fails, add a "-sourcepath path" argument to it and retry, adjusting the source path until javac completes without errors. DO NOT add a class path argument unless it's for an already translated library like libjunit.a -- all app dependencies should use Java sources (if you don't have source, then the code can't be translated).
The third step: a) lists the class files javac generated, b) filters out any inner or anonymous classes from that list, c) converts the ".class" suffixes to ".java", d) removes the /tmp/javac from the file names, and e) saves the list to the sources.list file. 
The fourth step creates a list of ".m" files for each Java source, saving it to objc-files.list.

These steps generate the complete closure of all source files needed for the app. Now, translate them all ("j2objc -d /tmp/build flags $(cat sources.list)" will do it in one step), then compile them all ("j2objcc -o executable_name -I/tmp/build $(cat objc-files.list)"). Since sources.list has all the Java dependencies, objc-files.list will have all the dependent code, resolving any link errors from missing object files.

mvn test
runs 1018 tests as java, all good, proceed

mvn dependency:unpack-dependencies -Dclassifier=sources
this puts all the stuff in target/dependency
